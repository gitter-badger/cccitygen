ComputerCraft Procedural City Generation Framework - taking city generation with command computers to the next level.

This project aims at providing a solid, object-oriented base for procedural city generation in Minecraft. Rather than being a single script (as most of other city generators out there), CCCG mirrors the hierarchy of real world cities in OOP, from districts down to furniture in individual rooms, and uses this pattern rebuild these structures in Minecraft worlds, procedurally. Apart from being a framework, it also includes example city generation scripts and working assets that can be used freely in any other project (open source FTW!
